         * TreeSet turns out to be a super handy data structure for this problem. It implements Set
         * interface and keeps elements in sorted order, plus it has two very handy APIs:
         * <p>
         * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html#ceiling(E): Returns the
         * least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no
         * such element.
         * <p>
         * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html#floor(E): Returns the
         * greatest element in this set less than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no
         * such element.
         * <p>
         * Idea: loop through this array, keep adding each element into the TreeSet, also keep an eye on
         * the size of the TreeSet, if it's greater than the required distance of k, then we remove the
         * left-most or oldest one from the set. For each element, we get the current floor and the
         * current ceiling and see if it works, if it does, then we return true immediately, otherwise,
         * we continue. Return false when we finished the loop.
