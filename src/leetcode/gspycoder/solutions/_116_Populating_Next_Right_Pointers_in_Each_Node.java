/**
 * 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
 * <p>
 * Given a binary tree
 * <p>
 * struct TreeLinkNode {
 * TreeLinkNode *left;
 * TreeLinkNode *right;
 * TreeLinkNode *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
 * For example,
 * Given the following perfect binary tree,
 *          1
 *        /  \
 *       2    3
 *      / \  / \
 *     4  5 6   7
 * <p>
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 *          1 -> NULL
 *        /   \
 *       2  -> 3 -> NULL
 *      / \   / \
 *     4->5->6->7 -> NULL
 *
 * Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}
 *
 * Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}
 *
 * Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
