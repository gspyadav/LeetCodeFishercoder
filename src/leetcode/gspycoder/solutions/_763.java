/**
 * 763. Partition Labels
 *
 * A string S of lowercase letters is given.
 * We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears
 * in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

 Example 1:
 Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
 Output: [9,7,8]
 Explanation:
 The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
 This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
 A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

 Note:
 S will have length in range [1, 500].
 S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.
